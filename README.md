## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Credit Card Customers to better understand:

1.  Which is the impact of the education level into the income salary?
2.  Is there any influnce of the gender into the salary income?
    - Which gender is more prone to churn the bank?
3.  Higher studies implies more responsabilities with your account?
4.  Higher income implies less depts?
5.  What make a person churn the bank?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions (ChurnQuestion, DeptsQuestion, SalaryQuestions). Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is also a file with an exploration of the data. (DataExploration)

The file 'BankChurners.csv' is the data set used to anserw the questions.
